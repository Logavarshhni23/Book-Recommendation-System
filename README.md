BOOK RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM 

This project is a simple console-based Book Recommendation System developed using Java and SQL database.It is designed to help users easily discover books they may like. Users can create an account, browse or search books, rate the ones they have read, and get personalized recommendations. The system stores book details and user preferences in a database, making it efficient and organized.

The main goal of the project is to provide a user-friendly system that demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Java along with database connectivity (JDBC). Although it is console-based, the system mimics the basic features of real-world online book platforms in a simple and educational way.
